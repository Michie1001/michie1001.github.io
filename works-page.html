					<p>This is a project I voluntarily worked on  (being a fan) for a film maker known as Casey Neistat for his company (368). This project and others where I voluntarily created pages for companies in my spare time don't count as company work because I wasn't required to do so, and the template I created for this project is free for duplication and images here are all credited to 368's Instagram.<br> The template available here is a vanilla version because the actual site won't be built without actual permission from 368.</p>

					<h2><a href="404.html">Fluffer</a></h2>
					<p>This is a mobile application under the brand, Mist. It is a necessity for all travellers seeking organization, speed and pocket knowledge while exploring the world. The features are numerous and exciting but won't be shared until the application is actually up and running.<br>
					This application is being made with Flutter, Ionic or React Native (whichever floats my boat when the time comes) and the webpage which is just an overview of what the app does - making your trips stress-free - is just a click away.<br>
					Once again, the template I created while demonstrating the frontend architecture, BEM, is free for duplication.</p>

					<p>This project is also a mobile application under the branc, Mist.

Don't boil up, blow off that constantly swirling steam here. <br>Of course, this is overview is also made with vanillaJS and is free for dupilcation. </p>

			<b>Hi, Mist here! Read up.</b><br><br>
			
			<b>-</b> If you're on here, chances are you wanna see my portfolio, this <b>"Works"</b> page has that covered, so just keep scrolling. I'm currently a freelance mafia (yes, mafia lol) also open for fulltime  placements and relocation, so hiring managers/ contractors, enjoy!<br><br>
			<b>-</b> This is my personal site, so I will include no company projects I have taken part in which may be stated in my resume. If you wish to see the work I've done with a company, links are in my <b><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rzZZvQ6XHpDlkGXtlOw2ih2LKDJzf9Hu">resume</a></b> and references are available on request.<br><br>
			<b>-</b> The media files used on this site are mine, I either photographed them or was photographed in them, both attributing ownership to me in its own way<b> ..so don't bug me about copyright.</b><br><br>
			<b>-</b> Once again stressing that this is my personal site, don't be bothered about the different features I add to the site and the conflicting themes on each click, I use it to test my knowledge on different tools and ideas all the time. <br><br>
			<b>-</b> Being a fulltime wanderer consumed entirely and unapologetically by wanderlust, I have a section for documenting my travels and with time, when I get proper equipment and hopefully, sponsorship, I would begin a travel blog. <br><b>Ps_This is a shameless plea for travel sponsorship and assignments ..wink wink</b><br><br>
			<b>-</b> The write-ups available in my <b>"Rants"</b> section are brain children of my sleepless nights searching for inspiration and a sense of validation in my abilities. Works here include tutorials (technical and creative), random advice, stories, poems and facts. <b>Don't judge!</b><br><br>
			<b>-</b> Be warned, the <b>Aesthetics</b> section may or may not be slow until I master site speed. So ignore the speed of that section, heck, don't open it at all if you hate waiting. It simply contains some of my best works (sketches, photography and animations/gameplay screenshots)<br><br>
			<b>-</b> Lastly, I consult on stuff ...a lot of stuff. Find out in the <b>Consultancy</b> section. <br><br><b>Let's connect</b> &#x1f609;
